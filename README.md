Guvi Capstone final project

Problem: Predict hospital readmissions within 30 days.

Objective: The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify patients who are at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days after their initial discharge.

Tasks:

Data Preprocessing: This task involves cleaning and preparing the healthcare data. You'll need to handle missing values, perform data normalization or scaling, and deal with categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that can be used for predictive modeling. This may involve extracting patient demographics, medical history, previous hospitalizations, and other relevant information.
Model Building: Develop a machine learning or statistical model that can predict the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days. Common approaches include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or more advanced models like gradient boosting or neural networks.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
Tools Used:

Python: Python is chosen as the main programming language for its readability, versatility, and extensive community support. It provides a robust foundation for data science and machine learning projects.

Scikit-Learn: Scikit-Learn is a popular machine learning library in Python. It offers a wide range of tools for building and evaluating machine learning models. In this project, Scikit-Learn is used for modeling tasks.

Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It provides data structures such as DataFrames, making it easy to manipulate and analyze structured data. Pandas is employed for efficient data handling in this project.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Matplotlib and Seaborn are libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib provides a comprehensive set of plotting tools, while Seaborn simplifies the creation of aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics. Both are utilized for data visualization in this project.
